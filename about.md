I want you to genuinely think hard, really hard about what on earth this mod
could possibly do like could does this mod ever do I truly wonder sadly there
are no mod names on the geode mod index so we may never know what this mod could
do which is unfortunately very sad

...but it does have a nice toggle in the pause menu!

(why isn't this a vanilla feature?)
